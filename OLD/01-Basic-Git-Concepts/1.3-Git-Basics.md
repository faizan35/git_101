### 1.3. **Git Basics**

Now that Git is installed and configured, it's time to dive into the basics of using Git. This section covers the fundamental commands and operations you'll need to manage a Git repository.

#### 1.3.1. **Initializing a Repository (`git init`)**

To start tracking a project with Git, you need to initialize a repository. This creates a `.git` directory in your project, which is where Git stores all its data.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - Navigate to the directory of your project:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```
  - Initialize the Git repository:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
  - This command will create a `.git` folder in your directory, indicating that Git is now tracking changes in this project.

#### 1.3.2. **Cloning a Repository (`git clone`)**

Cloning is the process of creating a copy of an existing Git repository. This is often used to get a working copy of a project from a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To clone a repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
    ```
  - This command creates a new directory with the same name as the repository and initializes it with all the files and history of the remote repository.

#### 1.3.3. **Checking the Status of Files (`git status`)**

The `git status` command gives you information about the current state of your working directory and the staging area. It shows which files have been modified, which are staged for commit, and which are untracked by Git.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - Simply run the command in your repository:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
  - This will display:
    - Untracked files (files not added to the repository yet)
    - Changes that are staged for the next commit
    - Changes that are not yet staged for commit
    - The current branch and any uncommitted changes

#### 1.3.4. **Adding Files to Staging (`git add`)**

Before you commit changes, you need to add them to the staging area. The staging area is where you prepare changes before committing them.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git add <file>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To stage a single file:
    ```bash
    git add filename.txt
    ```
  - To stage multiple files:
    ```bash
    git add file1.txt file2.txt
    ```
  - To stage all changes (including new, modified, and deleted files):
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
  - Staging files doesn't create a commit; it just prepares the changes for the next commit.

#### 1.3.5. **Committing Changes (`git commit`)**

Committing records the changes you've staged in the repository's history. Each commit is a snapshot of your project at a certain point in time.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Commit message"
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To commit the staged changes with a message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Added new feature"
    ```
  - The commit message should be a brief description of what changes were made in this commit.
  - If you want to include all changes (staged and unstaged) in the commit, use:
    ```bash
    git commit -a -m "Commit message"
    ```
    - Note: This option only works with tracked files (files that have been previously added to the repository).

#### 1.3.6. **Viewing Commit History (`git log`)**

The `git log` command shows the commit history of the repository. It allows you to see the sequence of commits, who made them, and their messages.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git log
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To view the commit history:
    ```bash
    git log
    ```
  - By default, this command shows:
    - Commit hash (a unique identifier for each commit)
    - Author of the commit
    - Date of the commit
    - Commit message
  - To see a summary of the changes in each commit:
    ```bash
    git log --stat
    ```
  - To see a more condensed log:
    ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```
    - This shows each commit as a single line, which is useful for getting a quick overview.
