# 2.1. **Branching**

Branching is one of Git's most powerful features, allowing you to create separate lines of development within a repository. This is particularly useful for developing new features, fixing bugs, or experimenting without affecting the main codebase.

#### 2.1.1. **Creating Branches (`git branch`)**

A branch in Git represents an independent line of development. By default, Git has a branch named `main` or `master`. You can create new branches to work on different features or fixes.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git branch <branch-name>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To create a new branch named `feature-branch`:
    ```bash
    git branch feature-branch
    ```
  - This command creates the branch, but it does not switch you to the new branch. You will remain on your current branch (likely `main` or `master`).

#### 2.1.2. **Switching Branches (`git checkout`)**

After creating a branch, you need to switch to it to start working on it. The `git checkout` command is used to switch between branches.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To switch to the `feature-branch`:
    ```bash
    git checkout feature-branch
    ```
  - After running this command, you are now on the `feature-branch`, and any changes you make will be associated with this branch.

#### 2.1.3. **Creating and Switching in One Command (`git checkout -b`)**

Git allows you to create and switch to a new branch in a single step using the `-b` flag with `git checkout`.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <branch-name>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To create a new branch named `new-feature` and switch to it immediately:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b new-feature
    ```
  - This command combines the creation of the branch and switching to it in one step, making it more efficient when starting a new line of development.

#### Example Workflow for Branching

1. **Starting on the main branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Creating and switching to a new branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-xyz
   ```

3. **Making changes on the `feature-xyz` branch.**

4. **Committing the changes:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implemented feature XYZ"
   ```

5. **Switching back to the main branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

Branches in Git are lightweight and can be created quickly. This allows for an efficient workflow where you can easily create, switch between, and delete branches as needed.
