### 2.2. **Merging**

Merging is the process of combining the changes from one branch into another. This is a crucial step when youâ€™ve finished working on a feature or fix in a separate branch and want to integrate those changes back into the main codebase.

#### 2.2.1. **Merging Branches (`git merge`)**

The `git merge` command is used to merge the changes from one branch into another. Typically, you would merge a feature branch into the main branch after the work is complete.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git merge <branch-name>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - First, switch to the branch you want to merge changes into, usually the main branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```
  - Then, merge the changes from the feature branch:
    ```bash
    git merge feature-xyz
    ```
  - This command will incorporate all the changes from `feature-xyz` into the `main` branch.

#### 2.2.2. **Fast-Forward vs. Three-Way Merges**

Git can perform two types of merges: fast-forward and three-way merges.

- **Fast-Forward Merge:**

  - A fast-forward merge occurs when there is a direct path from the current branch to the branch being merged. In this case, Git simply moves the current branch pointer forward to the new branch.
  - This type of merge does not create a new commit, making it a simpler and cleaner history.
  - Example:
    - Before merging:
      ```
      main: A---B---C
                    \
      feature:       D---E
      ```
    - After fast-forward merge:
      ```
      main: A---B---C---D---E
      ```

- **Three-Way Merge:**
  - A three-way merge is required when there have been divergent changes in the two branches being merged. Git combines the changes from both branches and creates a new commit to represent the merge.
  - This type of merge creates a new commit even if the branches were not directly connected.
  - Example:
    - Before merging:
      ```
      main: A---B---C
                \
      feature:   D---E
      ```
    - After three-way merge:
      ```
      main: A---B---C---M
                \     /
      feature:   D---E
      ```
    - Here, `M` is the merge commit that combines changes from both branches.

#### 2.2.3. **Resolving Merge Conflicts**

Merge conflicts occur when Git is unable to automatically reconcile the differences between two branches. This typically happens when the same lines of code have been altered in both branches.

- **Identifying Conflicts:**

  - During a merge, if Git encounters conflicts, it will stop the merge process and mark the conflicted files.
  - You can check the status to see which files are in conflict:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```

- **Resolving Conflicts:**

  - Open the conflicted files in a text editor. Git will mark the conflicting sections with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers.
  - Example:
    ```diff
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    code from the main branch
    =======
    code from the feature branch
    >>>>>>> feature-xyz
    ```
  - Edit the file to resolve the conflict by choosing the correct code or merging the changes manually.
  - After resolving conflicts, add the resolved files to the staging area:
    ```bash
    git add <resolved-file>
    ```

- **Completing the Merge:**
  - Once all conflicts are resolved and staged, you can complete the merge:
    ```bash
    git commit
    ```
  - Git will create a merge commit that includes the resolved changes.
