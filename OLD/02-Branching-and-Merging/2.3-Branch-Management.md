# 2.3. **Branch Management**

Managing branches effectively is key to maintaining a clean and organized Git workflow. This section covers how to delete and rename branches, which are common tasks when handling multiple branches in a project.

#### 2.3.1. **Deleting Branches (`git branch -d`)**

Once a branch has been merged or is no longer needed, you may want to delete it to keep your repository clean.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git branch -d <branch-name>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To delete a branch named `feature-xyz`:
    ```bash
    git branch -d feature-xyz
    ```
  - This command will delete the `feature-xyz` branch, but only if it has been fully merged into the current branch or another branch. If the branch has unmerged changes, Git will prevent deletion to avoid losing work.
  - If you need to force-delete a branch that hasn’t been merged, you can use the `-D` flag:
    ```bash
    git branch -D feature-xyz
    ```
  - **Caution:** Force-deleting a branch will permanently remove it and its changes, so use this option carefully.

#### 2.3.2. **Renaming Branches (`git branch -m`)**

Sometimes you may want to rename a branch, for example, to give it a more descriptive name or to correct a typo.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git branch -m <new-branch-name>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To rename the current branch to `new-name`:
    ```bash
    git branch -m new-name
    ```
  - If you want to rename a different branch without switching to it first, use:
    ```bash
    git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>
    ```
  - Example:
    ```bash
    git branch -m feature-xyz feature-enhancement
    ```
  - This renames `feature-xyz` to `feature-enhancement`.

#### Example Workflow for Branch Management

1. **Deleting a Merged Branch:**

   - After merging a branch into `main`:
     ```bash
     git branch -d feature-xyz
     ```

2. **Force Deleting an Unmerged Branch:**

   - If a branch is no longer needed and hasn’t been merged:
     ```bash
     git branch -D outdated-branch
     ```

3. **Renaming a Branch:**

   - While on the branch to be renamed:
     ```bash
     git branch -m new-branch-name
     ```

4. **Renaming a Branch Without Switching:**
   - If you want to rename a branch you’re not currently on:
     ```bash
     git branch -m old-name new-name
     ```
