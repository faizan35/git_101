# 3.3. **Pushing**

Pushing is the process of uploading your local changes to a remote repository. This allows others to access your updates, making it an essential part of collaborative workflows in Git.

#### 3.3.1. **Pushing Changes to Remote (`git push`)**

Once you've made and committed changes locally, you can push them to a remote repository to share them with others.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
  ```
- **Usage:**

  - To push the changes in your current branch to the `origin` remote:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

  - `origin` is the default name for the **remote repository**.
  - `main` is the name of the branch.

  - This command uploads the commits from your local `main` branch to the `main` branch on the `origin` remote repository.

- **Example:**
  - After making changes locally and committing them:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add new feature"
    ```
  - You can push these changes to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
  - If the `main` branch on the remote repository doesn’t exist, Git will create it.

#### 3.3.2. **Force Pushing (`git push --force`)**

Sometimes, you may need to overwrite the history of a remote branch with your local branch’s history. This is typically done when you’ve rewritten commits (e.g., with `git rebase`) and want the remote repository to match your local changes exactly.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git push --force <remote-name> <branch-name>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To force push changes to the `main` branch on `origin`:
    ```bash
    git push --force origin main
    ```
  - This command forcibly updates the remote `main` branch to match your local `main` branch, even if it means discarding remote commits that are not in your local branch.
- **Example:**
  - If you’ve rebased your commits locally and want to update the remote branch:
    ```bash
    git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Rebase the last 3 commits
    git push --force origin main
    ```
  - **Caution:** Force pushing can overwrite changes in the remote repository, potentially causing loss of work for collaborators. Use it carefully and ensure you’re not discarding any important changes.

#### 3.3.3. **Pushing to a New Branch**

If you want to push your changes to a new branch on the remote repository that doesn’t yet exist, you can specify the branch name in the push command.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git push <remote-name> <local-branch-name>:<remote-branch-name>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To push your local `feature-branch` to a new branch on the remote:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature-branch:new-feature-branch
    ```
  - This creates a new branch named `new-feature-branch` on the remote and pushes your changes there.

#### 3.3.4. **Tracking Branches**

When you push a branch for the first time, you can set it up to track the remote branch. This makes it easier to push changes in the future.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git push -u <remote-name> <branch-name>
  ```
- **Usage:**
  - To push the `main` branch and set it to track `origin/main`:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
  - After this, you can push future changes with just `git push` because Git knows which remote branch to push to.

#### Example Workflow for Pushing

1. **Pushing Regular Changes:**

   - After making commits, push them to the remote `main` branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Force Pushing after a Rebase:**

   - If you rebased your branch and need to force the remote to match:
     ```bash
     git push --force origin main
     ```

3. **Pushing to a New Branch:**

   - If you want to create a new branch on the remote and push your changes there:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch:new-feature-branch
     ```

4. **Setting a Tracking Branch:**
   - Push a branch and set up tracking for easier future pushes:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin main
     ```
