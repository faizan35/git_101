# 4.1. **Pull Requests (PR)**

Pull Requests (PRs) are a key feature of platforms like GitHub that facilitate code review and collaboration. They allow you to propose changes to a codebase, review those changes, and merge them into the main branch once they’re approved.

## What is Pull Requests...??

A Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge changes from a feature branch into the main branch. It allows for code review and discussion before integration.

### Story: PersonA and PersonB

**PersonA:**

- **Develops** a new feature on a branch called `feature/new-dashboard`.
- **Pushes** the changes and creates a PR to merge into the `main` branch.

**PersonB:**

- **Reviews** the PR, providing feedback and requesting minor changes.
- **Approves** and **merges** the PR once the changes are addressed.

**Outcome:** The new feature is integrated into the main codebase after review.

#### 4.1.1. **Creating Pull Requests on GitHub**

To propose changes via a pull request, follow these steps:

1. **Push Your Changes to a Branch:**

   - First, ensure your local changes are committed and pushed to a branch on the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch
     ```

2. **Create a Pull Request:**

   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the “Pull requests” tab.
   - Click the “New pull request” button.
   - Choose the base branch (the branch you want to merge changes into, e.g., `main`) and the compare branch (the branch with your changes, e.g., `feature-branch`).
   - Review the changes, add a title and description, and then click “Create pull request.”

3. **Submit the Pull Request:**
   - After creating the pull request, it will be visible to collaborators. They can review the changes and leave comments or request modifications.

#### 4.1.2. **Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests**

Once a pull request is created, it needs to be reviewed and merged:

1. **Review the Pull Request:**

   - Navigate to the “Pull requests” tab and select the PR you want to review.
   - Examine the changes by looking at the “Files changed” tab.
   - Leave comments or feedback using the comment box. You can comment on specific lines of code or provide general feedback.

2. **Approve or Request Changes:**

   - If the changes are satisfactory, click “Approve” to approve the pull request.
   - If changes are needed, click “Request changes” and specify what needs to be modified.

3. **Merge the Pull Request:**

   - Once the PR is approved, you can merge it into the base branch:
     - Click the “Merge pull request” button.
     - Optionally, add a merge commit message.
     - Click “Confirm merge” to complete the merge.

4. **Close the Pull Request:**
   - If the changes are not needed or if the PR is not going to be merged, you can close it without merging.

#### 4.1.3. **Resolving Conflicts in Pull Requests**

If there are conflicts between the base branch and the pull request branch, you’ll need to resolve them before merging:

1. **Identify Conflicts:**

   - GitHub will indicate if there are merge conflicts when you try to merge a pull request.
   - Conflicts must be resolved before the PR can be merged.

2. **Resolve Conflicts Locally:**

   - Pull the latest changes from the base branch into your local branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature-branch
     git pull origin main
     ```
   - Resolve conflicts in your code editor.
   - After resolving conflicts, commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git add <resolved-files>
     git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
     ```
   - Push the resolved branch back to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch
     ```

3. **Update the Pull Request:**
   - Once conflicts are resolved and pushed, GitHub will automatically update the pull request, and you can proceed with merging it.

#### Example Workflow for Pull Requests

1. **Creating a Pull Request:**

   - After pushing changes to `feature-branch`:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch
     ```
   - Create a PR on GitHub from `feature-branch` to `main`.

2. **Reviewing a Pull Request:**

   - Review the PR, provide feedback, and approve it if it meets the standards.

3. **Merging a Pull Request:**

   - Once approved and conflicts are resolved, merge the PR into `main`.

4. **Resolving Conflicts:**
   - Resolve any merge conflicts locally, commit, and push the resolved branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature-branch
     git pull origin main
     # Resolve conflicts
     git add <resolved-files>
     git commit -m "Resolve conflicts"
     git push origin feature-branch
     ```
