# 4.2. **Code Reviews**

Code reviews are a critical aspect of collaborative development, ensuring code quality and consistency across the project. On GitHub, code reviews are facilitated through pull requests (PRs), where team members review proposed changes before they are merged into the main branch.

#### 4.2.1. **Performing Code Reviews on GitHub**

1. **Access the Pull Request:**

   - Go to the “Pull requests” tab of your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the pull request you want to review.

2. **Review Changes:**

   - **Files Changed Tab:**
     - Click on the “Files changed” tab to see a diff of the changes made in the pull request.
     - Review each change and understand the impact on the codebase.
   - **Inline Comments:**
     - You can comment directly on specific lines of code by hovering over the line and clicking the “+” button that appears.
     - Leave comments regarding any issues, suggestions, or questions you might have.

3. **Provide Feedback:**

   - Use the comment box to provide overall feedback on the pull request.
