# 5.1. **Rebasing**

Rebasing is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another by rewriting commit history.

#### 5.1.1. **Interactive Rebasing (`git rebase -i`)**

Interactive rebasing lets you edit commits in your branch to clean up your commit history.

1. **Start Interactive Rebase:**

   - Run the command to start an interactive rebase from a specified commit:
     ```bash
     git rebase -i HEAD~n
     ```
   - Replace `n` with the number of commits you want to rebase.

2. **Edit the Commit List:**

   - An editor will open with a list of commits. You can choose actions like `pick`, `reword`, `edit`, `squash`, or `fixup` for each commit.
   - Example:
     ```
     pick 1234567 Commit message 1
     squash 89abcdef Commit message 2
     ```

3. **Complete the Rebase:**
   - After editing the list, save and close the editor.
   - If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue the rebase with:
     ```bash
     git rebase --continue
     ```

#### 5.1.2. **Squashing Commits**

Squashing combines multiple commits into a single commit. It’s useful for cleaning up commit history before merging.

1. **Start Interactive Rebase:**

   - Use `git rebase -i HEAD~n` to open the list of commits.

2. **Mark Commits to Squash:**

   - In the editor, mark commits to be squashed with the `squash` or `s` keyword:
     ```
     pick 1234567 Commit message 1
     squash 89abcdef Commit message 2
     ```

3. **Edit Commit Message:**

   - After squashing, you’ll be prompted to edit the commit message. Combine messages if needed, then save and close.

4. **Complete the Rebase:**
   - Resolve conflicts if any, and continue with `git rebase --continue`.

#### 5.1.3. **Resolving Rebase Conflicts**

1. **Start Rebase:**

   - Begin the rebase operation:
     ```bash
     git rebase branch-name
     ```

2. **Resolve Conflicts:**

   - Git will pause and indicate files with conflicts. Edit these files to resolve conflicts.
   - Mark conflicts as resolved:
     ```bash
     git add <resolved-files>
     ```

3. **Continue Rebase:**

   - After resolving conflicts, continue with:
     ```bash
     git rebase --continue
     ```

4. **Abort Rebase (if necessary):**
   - If you need to cancel the rebase, use:
     ```bash
     git rebase --abort
     ```

#### Example of Rebasing

1. **Interactive Rebase:**

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~3
   ```

   - Edit the commit list to squash or reorder commits.

2. **Resolve Conflicts:**

   - If conflicts occur during rebase, resolve them and continue:
     ```bash
     git rebase --continue
     ```

3. **Finish Rebase:**
   - Complete the rebase operation and push changes if necessary:
     ```bash
     git push origin branch-name --force
     ```
