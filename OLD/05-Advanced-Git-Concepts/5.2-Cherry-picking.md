# 5.2. **Cherry-picking**

Cherry-picking is a Git operation used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another branch. Itâ€™s useful when you want to include a specific change without merging all changes from another branch.

#### 5.2.1. **Cherry-picking Commits (`git cherry-pick`)**

1. **Identify the Commit:**

   - Find the commit hash you want to cherry-pick. You can view commit history with:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```
   - Copy the hash of the commit you want to apply.

2. **Cherry-pick the Commit:**

   - Switch to the branch where you want to apply the commit:
     ```bash
     git checkout target-branch
     ```
   - Apply the commit using cherry-pick:
     ```bash
     git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
     ```
   - Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual commit hash you copied.

3. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**

   - If there are conflicts, Git will pause the cherry-pick process. Resolve conflicts manually, then mark them as resolved:
     ```bash
     git add <resolved-files>
     ```
   - Continue the cherry-pick process with:
     ```bash
     git cherry-pick --continue
     ```

4. **Abort Cherry-pick (if necessary):**
   - If you need to cancel the cherry-pick, use:
     ```bash
     git cherry-pick --abort
     ```

#### Example of Cherry-picking

1. **Find Commit:**

   - View commits on the branch with:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```
   - Suppose you find a commit with hash `abcd1234` that you want to cherry-pick.

2. **Cherry-pick Commit:**

   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   git cherry-pick abcd1234
   ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts (if necessary):**

   - If conflicts arise, edit the files to resolve them, then continue:
     ```bash
     git add conflict-file.txt
     git cherry-pick --continue
     ```

4. **Finish Cherry-pick:**
   - Push the changes to the remote repository if needed:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch
     ```

#### Summary

Cherry-picking allows you to apply specific commits from one branch to another. Use `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` to apply the changes, resolve conflicts if they arise, and handle the cherry-pick process accordingly.
