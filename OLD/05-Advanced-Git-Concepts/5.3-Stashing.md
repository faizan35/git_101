# 5.3. **Stashing**

Stashing temporarily saves changes that youâ€™re not ready to commit yet.

#### 5.3.1. **Stashing Changes (`git stash`)**

1. **Save Changes to Stash:**

   - To stash your current changes (both staged and unstaged), use:
     ```bash
     git stash
     ```
   - This saves your changes and reverts your working directory to match the last commit.

2. **View Stashes:**
   - List all stashed changes with:
     ```bash
     git stash list
     ```
   - This shows a list of stashes with identifiers like `stash@{0}`, `stash@{1}`, etc.

#### 5.3.2. **Applying Stashed Changes (`git stash apply`)**

1. **Apply Latest Stash:**

   - To apply the most recent stash without removing it from the stash list, use:
     ```bash
     git stash apply
     ```

2. **Apply Specific Stash:**

   - To apply a specific stash, use its identifier from `git stash list`:
     ```bash
     git stash apply stash@{0}
     ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   - If conflicts arise when applying a stash, resolve them manually. After resolving conflicts, mark them as resolved:
     ```bash
     git add <resolved-files>
     ```

#### 5.3.3. **Removing Stashes**

1. **Drop a Stash:**

   - After applying a stash, you can remove it from the list with:
     ```bash
     git stash drop stash@{0}
     ```

2. **Clear All Stashes:**
   - To remove all stashes, use:
     ```bash
     git stash clear
     ```

#### Example of Stashing

1. **Stash Changes:**

   - Save your changes to the stash:
     ```bash
     git stash
     ```

2. **Switch Branches or Pull Updates:**

   - Perform your necessary operations, such as switching branches or pulling updates.

3. **Apply Stashed Changes:**

   - Return to your previous branch and apply the stash:
     ```bash
     git checkout previous-branch
     git stash apply
     ```

4. **Resolve Conflicts (if necessary):**

   - If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue working.

5. **Remove Stash (if no longer needed):**
   - Remove the applied stash:
     ```bash
     git stash drop stash@{0}
     ```

#### Summary

Stashing allows you to temporarily save uncommitted changes and revert your working directory. Use `git stash` to save changes, `git stash apply` to restore them, and `git stash drop` to remove stashes once they are no longer needed.
