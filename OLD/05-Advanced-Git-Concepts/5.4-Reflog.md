# 5.4. **Reflog**

Git reflog is a mechanism to record updates to the tip of branches and other references. It helps you to view and recover lost commits or changes by showing the history of branch updates.

#### 5.4.1. **Understanding and Using Git Reflog (`git reflog`)**

1. **View Reflog:**

   - To view the reflog for your current branch, use:
     ```bash
     git reflog
     ```
   - This command shows a list of all recent actions (like commits, checkouts, resets) on the branch, including their commit hashes and messages.

2. **Recover Lost Commits:**

   - If youâ€™ve lost a commit or need to recover a branch state, find the desired commit hash from the reflog and reset or checkout to that commit:
     ```bash
     git checkout <commit-hash>
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can reset your branch to a specific commit:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard <commit-hash>
     ```

3. **Examples of Reflog Use:**

   - **Finding a Lost Commit:**

     - Suppose you accidentally reset or deleted a branch. Use `git reflog` to find the commit hash and recover it.

   - **Restoring a Branch:**
     - If you need to restore a branch to a previous state, use:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b new-branch <commit-hash>
       ```

#### Example of Using Reflog

1. **View Reflog:**

   ```bash
   git reflog
   ```

   - Output might show:
     ```
     a1b2c3d HEAD@{0}: commit: Added new feature
     e4f5g6h HEAD@{1}: commit: Fixed bug
     i7j8k9l HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from branchA to branchB
     ```

2. **Recover a Lost Commit:**

   - Find the commit hash `a1b2c3d` you want to recover and reset to it:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard a1b2c3d
     ```

3. **Create a New Branch from a Reflog Entry:**
   - Checkout to the desired commit and create a new branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b recovered-branch a1b2c3d
     ```

#### Summary

Git reflog helps track changes to branch tips and recover lost commits by showing the history of branch updates. Use `git reflog` to view the history, find specific commits, and restore or recover changes as needed.
