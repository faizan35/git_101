### 6.2. **Best Practices**

#### 6.2.1. **Writing Good Commit Messages**

1. **Be Descriptive:**

   - Clearly describe the purpose of the commit. A good message explains why the change was made and what it does.
   - **Example:**
     ```
     Fix login issue with session management
     ```

2. **Use Imperative Mood:**

   - Write commit messages in the imperative mood, as if giving a command.
   - **Example:**
     ```
     Add user profile page
     ```

3. **Structure Your Messages:**

   - Use a concise title (under 50 characters) followed by a blank line and a more detailed description if needed.
   - **Example:**

     ```
     Update README with setup instructions

     Added detailed instructions for setting up the project environment.
     ```

4. **Reference Issues and Pull Requests:**
   - Include references to related issues or pull requests in the commit message.
   - **Example:**
     ```
     Resolve issue #123 by refactoring user authentication
     ```

#### 6.2.2. **Keeping a Clean Commit History**

1. **Make Atomic Commits:**

   - Each commit should represent a single logical change or fix. Avoid including unrelated changes in a single commit.

2. **Rebase Instead of Merge (for Feature Branches):**

   - Use interactive rebase to clean up your commit history before merging feature branches.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git rebase -i HEAD~n
     ```

3. **Squash Commits When Necessary:**

   - Combine multiple commits into a single commit for clarity when merging a feature branch.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git rebase -i HEAD~n
     ```

4. **Avoid Committing Sensitive Information:**
   - Ensure sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) is not included in your commits. Use `.gitignore` to exclude such files.

#### 6.2.3. **Avoiding Common Pitfalls**

1. **Do Not Commit Large Binary Files:**

   - Avoid committing large binary files as they bloat the repository. Use alternatives like Git LFS (Large File Storage) if necessary.

2. **Avoid Committing Generated Files:**

   - Do not commit files that are generated by the build process (e.g., `node_modules`, `dist`). Use `.gitignore` to prevent them from being tracked.

3. **Ensure Code Quality:**

   - Run tests and linters before committing to maintain code quality.

4. **Avoid Force Pushing to Shared Branches:**
   - Do not use force push (`git push --force`) on shared branches as it can rewrite commit history and affect other collaborators.

#### Summary

**Writing Good Commit Messages:**

- Use clear, descriptive messages in the imperative mood, and reference issues when relevant.

**Keeping a Clean Commit History:**

- Make atomic commits, rebase, squash commits as needed, and avoid committing sensitive information.

**Avoiding Common Pitfalls:**

- Exclude large binaries and generated files, ensure code quality, and avoid force pushing to shared branches.
