### 7.2. **Recovery**

#### 7.2.1. **Recovering Lost Commits and Branches**

1. **Using Reflog to Recover Lost Commits:**

   - Reflog records updates to the tips of branches and other references. You can use it to find lost commits or recover from accidental resets.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     git reflog
     ```
   - Identify the commit hash from the reflog and reset or checkout to that commit:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b recovered-branch <commit-hash>
     ```
     ```bash
     git reset --hard <commit-hash>
     ```

2. **Recovering a Deleted Branch:**
   - If you delete a branch and need to recover it, use reflog to find the last commit on that branch.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     git reflog show <branch-name>
     ```
   - Create a new branch from the last known commit:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <commit-hash>
     ```

#### 7.2.2. **Using Stash for Recovery**

1. **Applying Stashed Changes:**

   - If you have stashed changes and want to recover them, list your stashes and apply the one you need.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     git stash list
     git stash apply stash@{0}
     ```

2. **Creating a New Branch from Stashed Changes:**

   - To recover stashed changes in a new branch, apply the stash and create a new branch.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     git stash branch <new-branch-name> stash@{0}
     ```

3. **Handling Conflicts with Stashes:**
   - If conflicts arise when applying a stash, resolve them as you would with any merge conflict. After resolving, continue with the stashing process.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     git add <resolved-files>
     git stash apply
     ```

#### Summary

**Recovering Lost Commits and Branches:**

- Use `git reflog` to find and recover lost commits or branches. Reset or create new branches from the recovered commits.

**Using Stash for Recovery:**

- Apply stashed changes using `git stash apply` or create a new branch with `git stash branch` to recover stashed changes. Resolve conflicts as necessary.
