### 8.1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

#### 8.1.1. **Versioning Infrastructure Code with Git**

1. **Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
   - Common IaC tools include Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation.

2. **Storing IaC in Git Repositories:**

   - Treat your infrastructure code like application code by storing it in Git repositories.
   - Create a dedicated Git repository for your IaC scripts, or include them in your existing project repositories.

3. **Version Control for IaC:**

   - Use Git to version your infrastructure code, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others.
   - Ensure each change to your infrastructure code is committed with a clear and descriptive message.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git add main.tf
     git commit -m "Add S3 bucket configuration"
     git push origin main
     ```

4. **Branching and Merging for IaC:**

   - Use branches to develop and test changes to your infrastructure before merging them into the main branch.
   - Implement a workflow similar to software development, where changes are reviewed via pull requests before being merged.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git checkout -b add-ec2-instance
     git commit -m "Add EC2 instance configuration"
     git push origin add-ec2-instance
     ```

5. **Tracking Infrastructure Changes:**
   - By storing your IaC in Git, you can track and review all changes made to your infrastructure. This enables collaboration and ensures that changes are deliberate and documented.

#### 8.1.2. **Using GitHub for IaC Repositories**

1. **Hosting IaC Repositories on GitHub:**

   - Host your IaC repositories on GitHub to leverage features like pull requests, code reviews, and collaboration tools.
   - Ensure your repositories are structured and organized, with clear README files and documentation for each IaC module or script.

2. **Collaborating on IaC Projects:**

   - Use GitHub’s collaboration features to work with team members on IaC projects. Create issues, assign tasks, and use pull requests for code review.
   - Establish a clear branching strategy to manage changes effectively.

3. **GitHub Actions for IaC:**

   - Automate your infrastructure deployments using GitHub Actions. Set up workflows to trigger deployments, run tests, or validate configurations whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
   - **Example Workflow:**

     ```yaml
     name: Terraform Apply

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       apply:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v2

           - name: Set up Terraform
             uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

           - name: Terraform Apply
             run: terraform apply -auto-approve
     ```

4. **Versioning and Releasing IaC Modules:**
   - For modular IaC projects, use GitHub’s release feature to version and release different modules of your infrastructure code.
   - Tag specific versions of your code and create release notes to document changes.

#### Summary

**Versioning Infrastructure Code with Git:**

- Treat IaC as you would application code: store it in Git, use branches for development, and track all changes with commits.

**Using GitHub for IaC Repositories:**

- Host IaC projects on GitHub, leverage GitHub Actions for automation, and use releases to manage and distribute versions of your infrastructure code.
